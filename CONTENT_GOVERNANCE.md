# Content Governance

## Philosophy
HIFLIX is **NOT** an open User Generated Content (UGC) platform. It is a **curated** distinct experience.
The value of the platform lies in:
1.  **Control**: Knowing exactly what is shown.
2.  **Quality**: Ensuring high aesthetic and technical standards.
3.  **Safety**: Venues (clubs, lounges) need assurance that content is safe for public display (no sudden gore, offensive content, etc.).

## The "Invite-Only" Model
- We do not allow public sign-ups.
- Creators are "Guests" in our house. They are invited because we trust their style.
- Verification happens **before** the invite is sent.

## Moderation Strategy
### Pre-Publication Review
- **Why?** To prevent "bad" content from ever reaching a screen.
- **Process**: Nothing goes live without a human Admin clicking "Approve".
- **Scale**: Since this is a curated niche (Visuals), volume is manageable manually.

### Takedown Policy
- If a Guest wants their content gone, we respect it, but we process it via `pending_removal` to ensure we don't break active playlists abruptly during a show.
- Admins accept removal requests within 24-48h.

## Feedback Loop
- We encourage Guests to report issues or suggest categories via the internal feedback tool.
- This keeps communication structured and separate from casual chat.
